# CT-Math-Visualizations

This repository contains math visualizations created for the seminar: Computational Methods for X-ray Computed Tomography. The goal is to provide an introduction to the mathematical principles behind X-ray CT and their application in the field of imaging.

The visualizations in this repository are created using Python and various Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy. They illustrate important concepts and techniques used in X-ray Computed Tomography, including:

    Fourier Transform
    Convolution
    Applying Filters to reduce noise

The visualizations are clear and allow interactive exploration and modification of the code.
